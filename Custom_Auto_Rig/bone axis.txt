The above if it has none value. The below if the dictionary has a value. if it's 'alt'
run the above.

turn off all shapekeys with pass in name.

list of shapekeys, on each shapekey, iterate through dictionary keys to see if the name 
of the shapekey is in the dictionary keys. if it is, check the key value, if value is pass


if dictionary value is pass, pass
if dictionary key is in shapekey name - 
if dictionary value is not alt or pass, put value(name) into variable
if last character shapekey name is L or R
take last character and add _L or _R to name
this is driver target
elif is alt
