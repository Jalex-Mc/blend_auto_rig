My own custom auto rig for my blender rigs.
Move the bones and emptys into the correct area and run the scripts in order.
Couldn't run the script as one large script so I had to split them up,
but it allowed me to fix the IK pole angles at the end of the 1st and 3rd script.

Has everything but the custom properties and drivers
